# Inverse design of metasurface with non-local interations  

Evolutionary algorithm for inverse design of 1D cylindrical metalenses. 

The prerequisites are: numpy,scipy,[Deap](https://pypi.org/project/deap/)  
The code is interfaced with Lumerical FDTD solver.  

## Example Usage 
To run the code, place the required input files in the working directory and do 
`python ga.py 0`


The results obtained using the algorithm are publised [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-020-00369-5)
